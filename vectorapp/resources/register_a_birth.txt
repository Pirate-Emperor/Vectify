By law, you must register your baby's birth within 42 days.
All certificates must be paid for (we do not issue a free short birth certificate any more.)
Read the gov.uk guidance on who can register a birth (https://www.gov.uk/register-birth/who-
can-register-a-birth)

Where a birth should be registered 
A birth should be registered in the district where it happened. If the birth was within the City of
Manchester, for example, you need to make an appointment with the Manchester Register Office
(https://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/200010/births/492/register_a_birth/2). 
If your child was born outside of the City of Manchester, and you are not a Manchester resident, you
must register the birth in the district that your child was born. If you attend an appointment and
you are not a Manchester resident you will not be seen. If you are a resident in Salford, Bury,
Trafford or Rochdale, you can register the birth of any baby born in Manchester at the register
offices in the district where you live. However, you will not be able to register a Manchester
birth at Salford Register Office between 13 March 2024 and 12 April 2024. Normal service will
resume on 13 April.
It may be possible to give the details of the birth at another Register Office by making a declaration.
Not all register offices are able to attest declarations so you should check with your local office
before making an appointment. If you are a Manchester resident and wish to make a declaration in
relation to a baby born in another district please email us at registeroffice@manchester.gov.uk
